# unity_options_menu
https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/application-options-menu-creation

This project uses some advanced practices from programming systems and architecture mission. For example:
- Managers (singletones)
- Events (live changes in UI)
- Optimization (all logic on events, no useless updates, canvases for "dirty" UI)
- Scriptable objects (config file and custom localization)

Also I did some research and workarounds:
- Fix for dropdown scroll with a keyboard
- Reflections (probably not in the safest way)
- Editor UI modification (custom dropdown for localization selection)
